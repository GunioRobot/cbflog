changelog for CBFLog
===================

07/29/11:CBF (PB)
-----------------
- Changed file param char* to const char* to remove a compiler warning with objc++

11/18/10:CBF (PB)
-----------------
- Fixed issue with truncation when the string exceeded 60 characters. At that point, the math broke down and started putting positions and lengths outside the bounds of the string. This change will always center truncate regardless of string length.

06/18/09:CBF (PB)
------------------
- Patrick (pburleson) was kind enough to fix our singleton object. There was lots of
discussion about this on twitter the other night, and now it's fixed. We
now have a proper singleton instance that fixes the retain/release issues
that the sample singleton code from Apple introduced.

Thank you for taking care of this, Patrick!

05/09/09:CBF
------------
- Added a text macros definition for xCode. Just drop it in your textmacros
directory. (~/Library/Application
Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Specifications/)

02/25/09:CBF
------------
- Now defaults to using printf instead of NSLog. Slightly faster, but more
	importantly, it doesn't pollute your console/system.logs. There is also
	less before our information. You probably don't need
	it to tell you what the project name is, time, thread, etc.
- Now logs function name containing the log statement
- Added options to remove part or all of the output information (filename,
	line, function, severity)
- Can now alter log statement format in segments -- one for each part of
the log statement.


02/24/09:CBF
------------
- Added simple CBFLogDemo app to show how it works. Simply build/run to see
	our output. Play around with settings in CBFLog.h to see how it affects
	logging.
- Added this changelog.
- Added `DISABLE_NSLOG_WITH_CBFLOG` switch.
