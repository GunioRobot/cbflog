To use:

- Add CFLog.h to the files where you will be logging.
- Define _CFLOG_ENABLED. You can uncomment the first config line in CFLog.h or you can add it in your project settings.


I added -D_CFLOG_ENABLED to my Project Settings `Other C Flags` for my DEBUG project setting profile only. This means that my release and distro project profiles don't log anything, which is what I want. Logging is a fairly expensive process, so this should improve performance for your users.

CFLog can accept a couple arguments: Level and Override.
Debug levels are 1-5 (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
Override is nice, so you can turn the GLOBAL_SOFT_ENABLE setting to NO (off) and still log a few important things without commenting out all your logging statments.

I have included a few convenience functions that you can use:
cfDebug, cfInfo, cfWarning, cfError, cfCritical are mapped to a non-forced level-specific cfLog call.
